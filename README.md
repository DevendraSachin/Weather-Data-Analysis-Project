# Weather-Data-Analysis-Project

This project focuses on analyzing weather data using Python. The dataset contains various weather-related variables, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, and weather conditions, recorded at different times and dates.

The main goals of this project are:
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing or incorrect data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using statistics and graphs to explore and understand the data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Summarizing key weather parameters such as averages, medians, and ranges.
- **Visualizations**: Creating charts to show trends in temperature, humidity, and weather conditions over time.

## Summary

In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of the weather dataset step by step. We started with data cleaning to fix any issues in the dataset, followed by an exploratory analysis to uncover patterns and trends using statistics and visualizations.

The statistical summary provided key insights into the weather data, such as average temperatures, humidity levels, and extreme weather events. The visualizations helped reveal patterns and made it easier to understand the relationships between different weather variables.

This project serves as a simple example of how to analyze weather data and can be expanded with more advanced analytics or machine learning models.
